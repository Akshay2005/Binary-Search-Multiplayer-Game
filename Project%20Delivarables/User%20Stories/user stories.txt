
Story : Player clicks on start game

As a Player
I want to join a existing game
So that i can play along other players to compete


Scenario 1: Player joins existing game
Given that there is already a session running
and the players who joined the game earlier are playing
and the player has entered a unique player name
When a new player wants to join game in certain scenario
then he has to wait till the session ends
and the current should continue undisturbed
and the waiting player should get notified when connected to fresh session
and the current player should see the countdown time to start of next session


Scenario 2: entered player name already taken by other player
Given that user enters player name
and that name matches with player name of other player
when a new player wants to play the game under such circumstances
then the player should be prompted to change the name
and he should be alerted that entered name is already taken by other player
