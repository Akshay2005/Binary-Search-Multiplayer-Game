Extreme Programming (XP) Value: See the whole

Week 1
Practising XP means putting the team above all else and achieving the team's goals is your primary objective with achieving individual goals a secondary objective obtained via the former. I like the fact that each team member picks his or her own core value of which they will act as guardians making sure the team as a whole practices that value throughout the project.
Emphasizing this, when we had our first team meeting and each picked a value, I started visualizing the members not as individual cogwheels but as part of the same clockwork which if well oiled, will always tell the time perfectly. My task for me is cut out, I will strive towards making sure the team works in synchronization to achiving the team's objectives and in the process, they achive their own objectives as well. Also, when the team is bogged down or stuck at some point on a certain problem or backlog, I will make sure we step back for a bit and see the project as a whole. To see the backlog or problem as part of the larger picture, which may provide better insights into solving the problem. Also, we are developing a game which is going to be played by children and will teach them something valauble. I will make sure that this core principle is always on the back of all our minds so that it inspires creative influences in our programming of the game and understanding of the task at hand.

Week 2
This week was significant as we got to know a little bit more about each other's stregths and weaknesses, charting out a plan to assign work to each other based on our strengths and assist each other based on the latter. We debated for quite a while on selection of the game idea, game flow and division of future responsibilites. While supporting and taking part in this team debate, we lost the plot a few times i.e lost the main objective which is to design a game based on the backbone of a core CS algorithm. I worked towards identifying when this happened and then brought the discussion back on track. I am now trying to understand if it is possible for me to if not eliminate with time, then atleast be able to minimize such instances to increase future team discussions overall productivity.
As for my own case, I am trying to get everyone to visualize the entire task and the first step towards this is achieved by each one of us expressing thier own ideas in the form of a flow chart to finalize the game flow. It is also a learning experience to observe how my other team members are striving to imbibe into the rest, the spirit of thier selected XP values.

Week 3
We finally have a workflow finalized and a game plan to work on now. We have divided responsibilities among each other and are successfully communicating using Waffle, GitHub. Each team member now recognizes his reponsibility and people are starting to contribute in their own unique ways to the project. Finally understanding UML and how it can be converted to code is helping us focus on visualization which will be our target for this week. We have decided to work on UML this week and share our visualizations in the next team meeting. I feel this is one of the most important parts of our work till now, as UML will help us understand each other's vision about this project completely. I am excited to see what result this collabaroation of UML diagrams will bring to the table.
I am keeping true to my chosen XP value and implementing it successfully by analyzing in my mind how each decision that we take as team will affect the objective in the grand scheme of things. Trying to analyze the effect of each choice we make so as to stay on the path that we had chosen in the start. I must admit, it is difficult to keep true to my chosen XP value principle but I feel as though I am getting better at it everyday.
