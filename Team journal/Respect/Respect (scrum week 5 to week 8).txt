Week 5:

Early in the week we had standup discussing about scrum methodology and project design. We discussed our game design and implementation method in docker 
environment. Team members designed the client server communication using RMI but since professor introduced RESTful services and design patterns, we had to 
adapt to the new requirement.

Team respects each other considering the efforts they bring to the table. Sunil has made an effort to build up the starter code for the docker environment. 
Team discussed about the Restful services and how could we implement it in our game. Since Akshay has a experience in deploying applications in docker, team 
respected his inputs and suggestions regarding the docker usage for deploying applications. Everyone respects each other even if there exist differences in their 
thinking about something. They would bring up their idea during the discussion and respect what others had to say about it. They resolve the differences by 
adapting to idea that helps the project function smoothly.



Week 6 :

This week we had discussions based on game logic development and the design patterns that we need to implement. 
In this discussions we planned and analysed how to improve the game components little by little and collaborate end of the week. 
Every member of the team is contributing something important everyday and these efforts directed towards final picture of our project completion.


when one member is working on some component then others wait for the person to commit and consider his changes and work on it. 
I feel that this attitude is very essential for every project team and our team has great amount of it. Each member values the inputs of other members 
and develops components that is acceptable for the project. We plan to develop code and test parallelly through next two weeks and finally test whole project 
end to end.
