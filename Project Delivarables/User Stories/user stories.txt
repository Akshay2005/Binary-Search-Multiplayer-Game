Story : Player starting a game

As a Player
I want to either join a existing game or create my own game
So that i can play along other players to compete

Scenario 1: Player joins existing game
Given that there is already a session running
and the players who joined the game earlier are playing
When a new player wants to join game in certain scenario
then he has to wait till the session ends
and the current should continue undisturbed
and the waiting player should get notified when connected to fresh session.
