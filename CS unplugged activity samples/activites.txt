CS unplugged activities:

1. Error detection:

Select 36 cards which is colored white one side and black another side. Ask a kid to place 25 cads in 5*5 rows and column. 
Kid is free to keep card with any side. Now you add one row and column to make it 6*6. 
In this new row and column, add cards such that odd number of black is there. Now you close your eyes and ask the kid to turn any card.
Row and column in which this card lies, will have even number of blacks. Children will love it as it is like a magic to find which card they turned.

2. Image storage in computer:

This is a way to teach children hows information is stored in computer. Black/white image is stored in the form of 0,1 depending on the sequence black and white 
dots are there on the monitor window.
